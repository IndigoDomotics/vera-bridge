Vera Bridge
===========

The Vera Bridge plugin can be used to control devices defined in a Vera 3, Vera
Lite, or Vera Edge from MiCasaVerde (it may work with a Vera 2 if it's running
UI5). Note, this plugin only supports **on/off devices**, **dimmers**, **locks**, and
**thermostats**. See [Contributing](#contributing) below if you would like
to expand the list of supported device types.
